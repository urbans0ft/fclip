# fclip
In reference to the windows cmd "clip" fclip copies files to the windows clipboard so one can insert these files later on using ctrl + v.

Inspired by [stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/25708895/10224443).

# Usage
```
fclip.exe "C:\full\path\to\file.dat" "C:\more\files.dat"
```
That's it! Feel free to press ctrl + v to paste the files.
